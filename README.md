# Fake Images and Real Shapes

### by Leo Liu

## 3D Solids

#### Spinning a curve/2D shape about an axis
For example, spinning an S shaped curve around a vertical axis gets a vaselike solid.

#### Following a 2D shape along a curve
For example, following a circle along a curve gets a curved pipe.

## Additions if time allows

#### Mirrors / Reflective surfaces

#### More primitive polygons and 3D solids
